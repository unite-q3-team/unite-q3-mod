/* 
	Map rotation system

    \g_rotation server cvar must point on this file
	
	Syntax:

	$cvar1 = value1; // set cvar1 for each rotation step (i.e global)
	{...}
	"mapname1" // first map in rotation
	"mapname2" // second map in rotation
	{ 
		$cvar2 = value2; // set cvar2 only for "mapname2"
		@minPlayers = N; // optional: require at least N total players for this map
		@maxPlayers = M; // optional: require at most M total players for this map
		@minTeam = T;    // optional: in team modes, require at least T per team (red and blue)
		@maxTeam = K;    // optional: in team modes, require at most K per team (red and blue)
		@gametype = G;   // optional: require g_gametype == G
		@instagib = 0/1; // optional: require g_instagib off/on
		@freeze = 0/1;   // optional: require g_freeze off/on
		{...}
	}
	"mapname3" // third map in rotation
	{...}

	Note: its better to quote map names like "6++" which contains "+","-","&" etc. symbols

	Player-count-aware selection:
	- At the end of a match, the rotation will attempt to load the next map that satisfies
	  the declared constraints. If the next map does not satisfy them, it will try subsequent
	  maps in order, wrapping around once. If none satisfy, the server will pick a random
	  map from the rotation (ignoring constraints) and advance the rotation index accordingly.

	Notes:
	- Constraints are only recognized inside the braces directly following a map name.
	- In non-team modes, @minTeam/@maxTeam are ignored.
	- If no constraints are present for a map, it is always eligible.
